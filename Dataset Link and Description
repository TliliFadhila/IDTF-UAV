UAV Dataset Description
The dataset contains telemetry data from a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), with measurements taken at specific time intervals. Each row of the dataset represents a snapshot of the UAV's operational status and performance metrics. Below is a breakdown of the key fields:

time: Represents the timestamp for each data entry, indicating when the measurements were taken.

m2_cmd, m1_cmd, m4_cmd, m3_cmd: These columns correspond to the command values sent to each of the four motors of the UAV. Each value indicates the intended power or throttle for the respective motor.

x_actual, y_actual, z_actual: These fields represent the UAV's actual position in a three-dimensional space, indicating its coordinates along the x, y, and z axes.

clock: This field likely represents the system clock time, used for synchronizing data collection.

mvx, mvy, mvz: These fields show the UAV's movement velocities in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.

roll, yaw, pitch: These values describe the UAV's orientation in space. Roll indicates rotation around the x-axis, yaw indicates rotation around the z-axis, and pitch indicates rotation around the y-axis.

load_status: This field provides information about the UAV's load status, likely indicating whether it is carrying any additional payload.

rpm_m1, rpm_m2, rpm_m3, rpm_m4: These columns show the revolutions per minute (RPM) for each of the four motors, indicating their operational speeds.

I_m1, I_m2, I_m3, I_m4: These fields represent the current (in amperes) for each motor, showing the electrical consumption.

T_m1, T_m2, T_m3, T_m4: These columns indicate the temperature (in degrees Celsius) of each motor, providing insights into the thermal performance during operation.

Temp_R_1, Temp_A_1, Temp_B_1, Temp_C_1: These fields represent the temperatures of various sensors or components for motor 1, including reference and ambient temperatures.

fault: This column indicates whether any faults were detected during the operation, providing critical information for diagnosing potential issues.

Example Data Entry
Entry at time 0: The UAV has equal motor commands set at approximately 4398.23, with an actual position near the origin of the coordinate system (x: -3, y: -5, z: 0.06). The velocities (mvx, mvy, mvz) are zero, indicating no movement at this moment. The roll, yaw, and pitch angles are also zero, suggesting the UAV is in a stable orientation. All motor RPMs and temperatures are recorded, along with a load status of zero, indicating no payload. There are no detected faults during this time.

Indicators of Safe Flight
Stable Motor Commands:

The motor commands (m1_cmd, m2_cmd, m3_cmd, m4_cmd) are equal and remain at a high value (around 4398.23). This uniformity can indicate that the UAV is maintaining a stable power output across all motors, which is a positive sign for flight stability.
Position Data:

The actual position data (x_actual, y_actual, z_actual) shows relatively small values, suggesting that the UAV is likely close to the ground or hovering in a confined area. This is typical for safe, controlled flights.
Zero Velocities:

The velocities (mvx, mvy, mvz) are all zero, indicating that the UAV is not in motion at that moment. This could mean it is in a stable hover or waiting to execute further commands, which is generally safe behavior.
Zero Roll, Yaw, and Pitch:

The roll, yaw, and pitch angles being zero suggest that the UAV is level and not experiencing any unwanted rotation or tilting, which contributes to flight safety.
Normal RPM Values:

The RPM values for the motors (rpm_m1, rpm_m2, rpm_m3, rpm_m4) are all recorded (though the actual numbers were not provided). If these values are within normal operating ranges, it indicates that the motors are functioning properly.
Current and Temperature Readings:

The current readings (I_m1, I_m2, I_m3, I_m4) and temperature readings (T_m1, T_m2, T_m3, T_m4, etc.) are essential for monitoring motor performance. If these values are within normal limits (not exceeding the maximum rated current or temperature for the motors), it can indicate safe operation.
Load Status:

A load status of zero indicates that the UAV is not carrying any additional weight, which could enhance stability and safety during flight.
No Faults Detected:

The absence of faults in the fault column suggests that there are no detected issues with the UAV during this data collection period.
