This workflow shows how to use Simulink® to model a quadcopter based on the Parrot® series of minidrones.

The steps in this workflow describe the implementation details of the Parrot minidrone used in Quadcopter Modeling and Simulation based on Parrot Minidrone.

This workflow shows how to manage the model and source files, using Project Management.

This workflow shows the quadcopter in a 3D environment, using Simulink 3D Animation™.

For the collaborative development of a flight simulation application, this workflow provides an implementation of Flight Simulation template. For more information, see Projects Template for Flight Simulation Applications.

For hardware integration, this procedure requires the installation of the Simulink Support Package for Parrot Minidrones.

Follow the steps in Quadcopter Modeling and Simulation based on Parrot Minidrone to open a Simulink project with the asbQuadcopter model and load the required workspace variables.

Run the asbQuadcopter model in normal simulation mode. Navigate through the different subsystems to learn about the modeling hierarchy and quadcopter dynamics. You can also view the Simulink 3D Animation of the model. For more information, see Quadcopter Modeling and Simulation based on Parrot Minidrone.


This schematic shows these quadcopter physical characteristics: Axes, Mass and Inertia Rotors
